### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lukasz, Front-End Engineer / Full-Stack Developer based in Basildon, UK.

I graduated from OpenClassrooms in 2021 with Web Developer associate's level diploma and in 2023 with bachelor's level diploma as a result of my 3-year studies during which I developed multiple skills while working on real life Front-End and Full-Stack projects.

With a knowledge I obtained during my studies I was able to implement solutions based on web technologies that improved quality and productivity at my current work environment and are being used across UK network.

Now I am looking for an opportunity to move my career to the next step and join a team where I could develop and maintain web applications.
